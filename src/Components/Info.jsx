                The little guy challenged Wall Street in the infamous GameStop fiasco of 2021, and the legacy of those brave Wall Street Bets heroes endures until today.<br /><br />

                Born out of that movement is Wall Street Memes - the ultimate expression of the internet’s triumph over rampant capitalism. “Greed is good,” said Gordon Gekko in the ‘80s as he got rich off useless stocks.<br /><br />Around 30 years later, hundreds of arguably even more useless meme coins allow ordinary people to do the same.

                Wall Street Memes is tokenising the movement. Join the $WSM army today and prove that greed is, indeed, very good.
